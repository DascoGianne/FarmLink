            By creating an account or using our platform, you agree to the Terms and Conditions below.<br>
            Please read them carefully.
            <br><br>

            <b>1. Acceptance of Terms</b><br>
            By signing up, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and Conditions, 
            as well as our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you may not use the FarmLink services.
            <br><br>

            <b>2. About FarmLink</b><br>
            FarmLink is a digital marketplace that connects farmers, buyers, and NGO coordinators. 
            Our platform supports fair trade, transparent pricing, and efficient farm-to-market delivery.
            <br><br>

            <b>3. User Responsibilities</b><br>
            <b>• Farmers / NGOs</b> – Create accurate crop listings, update stock availability, and ensure correct information.<br>
            <b>• Buyers</b> – Purchase verified products directly from farmers through the platform.<br>
            <b>• FarmLink Team</b> – Maintains the system, ensures data integrity, and promotes fair platform usage.
            <br><br>

            <b>4. General User Rules</b><br>
            All users must:<br>
            • Provide truthful information when registering or posting.<br>
            • Follow local laws related to agriculture and commerce.<br>
            • Avoid fraudulent, harmful, misleading, or abusive activities.<br>
            • Manage their listings, messages, and transactions regularly.
            <br><br>

            <b>5. Product Listings & Transactions</b><br>
            • Prices and quantities shown are based on real-time data from farmers and verified by NGO coordinators.<br>
            • “Rescue Deals” (discounted near-expiry or oversupply produce) are automatically applied to reduce waste.<br>
            • FarmLink is not a direct seller or buyer—our role is to connect users within the marketplace.
            <br><br>

            <b>6. Payments & Deliveries</b><br>
            • Buyers must review order details before confirming payment.<br>
            • Deliveries are handled by approved logistics partners; costs are calculated based on distance and weight.<br>
            • Delays or damages caused by third-party logistics partners are beyond FarmLink’s direct control.
            <br><br>

            <b>7. Data & Privacy</b><br>
            FarmLink values your privacy. Your personal and transaction data are securely stored and used only 
            for platform-related purposes.<br>
