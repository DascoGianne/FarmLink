  <h1 class="tc-title">What is Freshness Rating?</h1>

  <p class="tc-paragraph">
    The Freshness Rating is a system that shows how recently a crop was harvested and how long it is expected
    to stay at its best quality. It displays a countdown (e.g., “Best within 2 days”, “Freshly harvested today”)
    based on the type of produce and its natural shelf life.
  </p>

  <p class="tc-paragraph tc-subhead">
    This helps buyers quickly understand:
  </p>

  <ul class="tc-list">
    <li>How fresh the produce is</li>
    <li>How soon it should be consumed or distributed</li>
    <li>Which items need priority purchase</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="tc-paragraph">
    For farmers, it adds transparency and improves trust. For buyers, it ensures confidence that they are
    purchasing fresh, quality goods.
